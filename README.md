# Energy Accountability and Loss Certification System

This repository contains the prototype implementation of an Energy Accountability
and Loss Certification System using ESP32 and digital energy meters.

## Project Overview
The system monitors electrical energy at multiple points and calculates energy
loss in real time. The dashboard visualizes input energy, output energy, loss,
and efficiency.

## Repository Structure
- dashboard: Web-based monitoring interface
- esp32: Microcontroller firmware (prototype)
- docs: System documentation

## Project Status
This project is currently in prototype stage. Hardware integration and
dashboard visualization are implemented. Live AC testing and cloud integration
are planned as future work.

## Future Scope
- Cloud database integration
- Automated loss alerts
- Certified energy efficiency reporting
